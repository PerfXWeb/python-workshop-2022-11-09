## Project - Validating and correlating stock market data

*(Source Code in sample_code/project_stock_correlation)*

### The issue
- We have raw data about two stocks
- Some dates and values are missing
- We want to clean the data and do some visualisation and maybe some correlation

### The solution
- Open the file in Python
- Use loops to go through all entries and validate them
- Write the cleaned dataset into another Excel sheet
- Create some visualizations and a correlation using matplotlib and sklearn
